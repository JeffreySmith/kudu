    Link with all target libraries
    
    In the parent commit, I forgot to update the build so that include-what-you-use
    links with all targets, which led to link failures for builds against LLVM build
    trees (as opposed to the Debian packages).
    
    While troubleshooting this, I found a patch by @Romain-Geissler-1A that I had
    previously misunderstood/overlooked:
    https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use/pull/854#issuecomment-732487734
    
    Borrowing the link dependencies from that patch to complete my accidental
    plagiarism fixes the build again.
